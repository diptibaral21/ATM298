# ATM298
This is my capstone project for ATM298 class (winter quarter 2026) with Dr. Erwan Monier. 

In this project, I will do geospatial data visualization. I will combine location information from shapefile with other datasets such as climate, vegetation, soil etc to visualize them together in a map. The datasets will be from California.
